<p>Throughout my tenure at Bocconi, I have been closely involved with Bocconi Students Investment Club, a prestigious finance association in which I deepen my knowledge of Corporate Finance through weekly presentations and articles on the most recent M&amp;A transactions. During my time with the club, I also had the opportunity to organise several events with senior speakers.</p>
<p>Here you can find some articles that I have written:</p>

<p>On another note, in order to graduate I had to write a thesis on a topic that I found particularly interesting during my three years at Bocconi. I chose to conduct an empirical analysis and write a thesis on private equity exits strategies. More specifically, the title of my theiss was: “Private equity exits: an empirical analysis of the European market”. Below you can find the introduction of my thesis.</p>
