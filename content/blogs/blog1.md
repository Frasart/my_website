title: About me
---

My name is Francesco Sartori, and I was born and raised in Treviso, a city in the north-east of Italy. \
During my high school years, I became really passionate about the business world and for this reason I decided to join the Bachelor in Economics and Management at Bocconi University. 

At the time, I was not really sure about what I wanted to do in life but I knew that I wanted to work in business. My undergrad studies helped me understand that I wanted to work in the financial world for several different reasons:
1. the finance subjects were the ones that I liked the most and the ones where I did best;
2. I really enjoy working with numbers;
3. the work is often very challenging;
4. the people with whom you work with are often very smart.

For these reasons, I decided to "commit" to the world of finance by joining the Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. I am sure that at LBS I will learn not only the theory of finance but also the practical skills necessary for a successful career in the industry.

With regards to my professional experiences, I have done several internships in different sectors. Indeed, I worked in wealth management, academics, and also as an investment intern this last summer. But you can take a look at my cv below to learn more about these experiences.

I am really passionate about sports, especially motorsports such as Formula 1 and MotoGP. I have also a great passion for food. I am really into michelin stars haute cuisine restaurants and have been to quite a few so far. I also enjoy to cook for myself or others.
