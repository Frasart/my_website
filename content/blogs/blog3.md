Throughout my tenure at Bocconi, I have been closely involved with Bocconi Students Investment Club, a prestigious finance association in which I deepen my knowledge of Corporate Finance through weekly presentations and articles on the most recent M&A transactions. During my time with the club, I also had the opportunity to organise several events with senior speakers. 

Here you can find some articles that I have written:

*[Not-so-Super League: Current state of the European football](https://bsic.it/not-so-super-league-current-state-of-the-european-football/)

*[The Private Credit Boom: The Next Big Thing in the Alternatives Market](https://bsic.it/the-private-credit-boom-the-next-big-thing-in-the-alternatives-market/)

*[WeWork's SPAC merger: its latest attempt to go public](https://bsic.it/weworks-spac-merger-its-latest-attempt-to-go-public/)

*[Allied takeover of G4S: the new global leader of security services](https://bsic.it/allied-takeover-of-g4s-the-new-global-leader-of-security-services/)

*[Renesas buys Semiconductor company Dialog in ???4.9bn deal](https://bsic.it/renesas-dialog/)

*[Green steel - the next largest industrial investment?](https://bsic.it/green-steel-the-next-largest-industrial-investment/)


On another note, in order to graduate I had to write a thesis on a topic that I found particularly interesting during my three years at Bocconi. I chose to conduct an empirical analysis and write a thesis on private equity exits strategies. More specifically, the title of my theiss was: "Private equity exits: an empirical analysis of the European market". Below you can find the introduction of my thesis.
