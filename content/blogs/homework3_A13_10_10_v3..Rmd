Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve


### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960
```{r}
  ggplot(yield_curve, aes(x = date, y = value, colour = duration)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~duration, nrow = 5)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960", y = "%", x = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  NULL
```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis
```{r}
yield_curve1 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))%>%
  filter(year(date) >= 1999, year(date) <= 2021) 


ggplot(yield_curve1, aes(x=maturity, y=value, colour = factor(year(date)), group=factor(month(date))))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~year(date), nrow = 6)+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("1m", "3m", "6m", "1y", "2y", "3y", "5y", "7y", "10y", "20y", "30y"))+
  labs(title = "U.S. Yield Curve", y = "Yield (%)", x = "Maturity") +
  NULL
```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999
```{r}

yield_3_10 <- filter(yield_curve, maturity == '3m' | maturity == '10y') %>%
  filter(year(date) >= 1999, year(date) <= 2021) 
  

ggplot(yield_3_10, aes(x = date, y = value, colour = duration)) +
  geom_line()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999", y = "%", x = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("Turquoise","Red"))+
  NULL
          
```



According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?
The yield curve actually becomes flatten before these recessions. Normally, the short-term interest rate hikes when the Fed rises the overnight rate to curb the inflation or any type of bubble. However, a flattening yield curve doesn't necessarily imply a recession. If the technology can continue to develop organically, the rise in aggregate demand may outweigh the effects of reducing aggregate supply. In that way, the recession may not occur. In 2006, short-term (3 months) once yields more than longer term (10 years) debt.


Let's create a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

```{r}

#create data set with just 3m yields
yield_3m <- yield_curve %>%
  filter(maturity == '3m')

#create data set with just 10y yields
yield_10y <- yield_curve %>%
  filter(maturity == '10y')

#combine the two data sets so that they are aligned with same date
yield_3_10 <- merge.data.frame(x = yield_3m, y = yield_10y, by = 'date', all.x = T)

#use mutate to calculate 10y - 3m yield difference
yield_diff_data <-yield_3_10 %>%
  mutate(yield_difference = value.y - value.x)%>%
#use mutate to create columns for yield difference that allow us to use the ribbon function
  mutate(upper_yield = ifelse(yield_difference >= 0, yield_difference, 0), lower_pct = ifelse(yield_difference <= 0, yield_difference, 0))

#plotting the grpah
ggplot(yield_diff_data, aes(x = date, y = yield_difference)) +

              fill = "red", alpha = 0.2, group = 1) +
  labs(title = "Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury rates", y = "Differences: 10-year minus 3-month yield in %", x = "") +
  geom_rug(sides="b",alpha = 0.2, color=ifelse(yield_diff_data$yield_difference > 0, "light blue", "red")) +
  geom_rect(data=filter(recessions, from >= "1960-01-01"), inherit.aes = F, mapping=aes(xmin=From, xmax= To, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf), color="NA", alpha=0.3)+ 
  NULL
